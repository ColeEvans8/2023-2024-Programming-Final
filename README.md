This is the page for my 2023-2024 Programming Final
In this you will see the game that I have made
In this game there is a Shark and a Submarine 
The Submarine shoots Torpedos(Left Arrow Key)
and tries to move to hit the Shark
The shark evades these Torpedos(W and S keys)
There is a 30 second timer before the Shark wins 
Or if the Shark gets hit 3 times the Submarine Wins
